## Notes

I started this task by just refactoring the functionalities:
 * Created global constants under config to change it in one place rather then all files.
 * Removed unnecessary try and catch in functions.
 * Initialized the project as node project.
 * Installed expect js and mocha by node package manager.
 * Refactored the functionalities into modules for reusability, and testability.
 

 ### Running the app

  * Install the packages by running npm install.
  * Install a live server witch you can have via:
    * VS code "Live server extension" or npm install -g live-server.

 
  ### Next step

  * We can add webpack + babel configuration so we can use the latest JS syntax (ES6/7) with Node and compile js code, and to that I prefer using React with JSX to standardize the codebase, also makes it testable and easier to organize and refactor, which is extremely useful for our application in the long run and already configured with babel and webpack.
